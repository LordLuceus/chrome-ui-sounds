# chrome-ui-sounds

An extension for Chromium-based browsers that plays sounds for important events in the browser

Play sounds for important events in the browser, such as loading a page or opening a new tab.

If you'd like the browser to audibly notify you when things happen, then this extension is for you.
Includes options to enable or disable individual sounds and change individual sound volume.

Special thanks to Andre Louis, who created the sounds for this project.
